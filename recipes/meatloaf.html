<h3>My Awesome Meat(loaf)</h3>
This is my really super cool <strong>meatloaf</strong> recipe i came up with while 
working in a nursing home. It's just like your grandma's classic
<strong>meatloaf</strong> with a slight <em>twist</em>. My recipe
uses all of the classic meatloaf ingredients such as ground beef, carrots, onions, and breadcrumbs, among other things.

    <li>combine ground beef, sausage, the diced onion and carrots, breadcrumbs, milk, eggs, and seasonings until you reach a dough like consistency</li>
